## Klipper Installation And Update Helper

This script was actually created for my personal use only but i then decided to make the script accessible for everyone.
It is meant to help guiding you through a complete fresh install of Klipper and optionally the DWC2 web UI + DWC2-for-Klipper.
There are also functions for updating your current installations or removing them from your system.

## First things first: When you decide to use this script, you use it at your own risk!

# THIS VERSION IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!! 
# BUGS MAY BE STILL PRESENT!!!
